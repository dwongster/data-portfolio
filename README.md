Here you can view several of my favorite projects that I've completed for various courses.

## E-Commerce Final Project
analysis of a report of sales transactions for an e-commerce site.  Appears to be a wholesaler of some type.  Analyzed the range of products that were sold to see what items sold the best, what type of customers were most profitable, and any other type of insights.

## Video Games Sales project
Analysis of console game sales through 2016.  This was an interesting project where I was able to utilize my own intimate knowledge of early game consoles with analyses of the sales data to provide a (hopefully) insightful breakdown.

## Murder Myster Note with text analysis
In this project, we were given texts:
* a murder note
* sample letters from three suspects
Using text analysis techniques, we need to determine which suspect most likely wrote the murder note
