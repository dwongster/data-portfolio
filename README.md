Here you can view several of my favorite projects that I've completed for various courses.

## [E-Commerce Final Project](https://github.com/dwongster/data-portfolio/blob/main/e_commerce_final_project_accepted_cleaned.ipynb)

Analysis of a report of sales transactions for an e-commerce site.  We were given dataset of about half million transactions that appear to come from a wholesaler of some type.  I wrote custom functions to help clean the data, including switching variable names from camelCased to snake_cased, analyzing nulls as percentages of whole (as a way to help determine whether to delete). I had to account for outliers and duplicates before analyzing the range of products that were sold to see what items sold the best, what type of customers were most profitable, and any other type of insights.

## Churn analysis project
Analyze the factors that impact churn most and draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service.

## AB Testing analysis project
Analysis of an AB test in an online store.

## Video Games Sales project
Analysis of console game sales through 2016.  This was an interesting project where I was able to utilize my own intimate knowledge of early game consoles with analyses of the sales data to provide a (hopefully) insightful breakdown.

## Murder Myster Note with text analysis
In this project, we were given texts:
* a murder note
* sample letters from three suspects
Using text analysis techniques, I needed
 to determine which suspect most likely wrote the murder note
